        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: November 21, 2025</p>

        <p>
            These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>Score Counting</strong> mobile application 
            (the “App”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. 
            If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Overview of the App</h2>
        <p>
            The App is designed to help users track and manage scores during games or matches. 
            It syncs scores across connected devices and may send notifications when scores change. 
            The App is intended for personal and non-commercial use unless explicitly permitted.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under 18, you may use the App 
            only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>By using the App, you agree that you will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App only for lawful purposes.</li>
            <li>Not misuse or attempt to disrupt the App’s services, servers, or networks.</li>
            <li>Not reverse engineer, copy, or modify the App or any part of it.</li>
            <li>Not use the App to upload harmful, offensive, or illegal content.</li>
            <li>Ensure that all match data or names you enter comply with applicable laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Account & Data</h2>
        <p>
            The App may store match data, scores, synchronization information, and device tokens 
            necessary for notifications. You are responsible for any content you input into the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            The App may send push notifications to connected devices when score updates occur. 
            You may disable notifications at any time in your device settings, but doing so may 
            limit some features of the App.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>
            All rights, title, and interest in the App—including software, design, text, graphics, 
            and trademarks—are owned by the App’s developer. You are granted a limited, 
            non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal use only.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for cheating, manipulation, or unfair competitive practices.</li>
            <li>Interfere with the App’s operation or attempt unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Use the App to distribute malware or harmful code.</li>
            <li>Resell or commercially exploit any part of the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App may use third-party services such as hosting providers or notification services. 
            These services are governed by their own terms and policies. We are not responsible 
            for any third-party actions or service interruptions.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
            The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. 
            We make no warranties or guarantees of any kind, express or implied, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>That the App will always function without errors or interruptions</li>
            <li>That score synchronization will be 100% accurate at all times</li>
            <li>That notifications will be delivered without delay or failure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You use the App at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages arising from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your use or inability to use the App</li>
            <li>Incorrect score updates or synchronization issues</li>
            <li>Lost or corrupted match data</li>
            <li>Notification delays or failures</li>
            <li>Technical errors, bugs, or downtime</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In no event will our total liability exceed the amount you paid to use the App (if any).
        </p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, without notice, 
            for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, 
            the App, or third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be effective when posted 
            on this page. Your continued use of the App following any changes constitutes 
            acceptance of the updated Terms.
