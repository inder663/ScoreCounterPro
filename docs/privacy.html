        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: November 21, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use
            the <strong>Score Counting</strong> mobile application (the “App”).
            <br>
            By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. About the App</h2>
        <p>
            The App is a simple score counting tool designed to help you track scores during matches and games.
            It synchronizes scores across connected devices in real time and can send notifications to devices
            that are connected to the same match session when scores are updated.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to collect only the minimum information required to operate and improve the App.
            Depending on how you use the App, we may collect the following types of information:
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Match & Score Data</h3>
        <p>To enable synchronization between devices and maintain match history, we may store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Match identifiers and session IDs</li>
            <li>Team names or player names you enter</li>
            <li>Score values, timestamps, and basic match settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is primarily technical and does not require you to submit any personally identifiable
            information. However, if you choose to use real names for teams or players, those names may be stored
            as part of the match data.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Device & Technical Information</h3>
        <p>
            When you use the App, we may automatically collect basic technical data to keep the App secure and
            functioning properly, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
            <li>App version and language settings</li>
            <li>Anonymous identifiers used for notifications or synchronization</li>
            <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Push Notification Tokens</h3>
        <p>
            To send score update notifications to your device, we may collect and store push notification tokens
            associated with your device. These tokens are used solely for delivering notifications related to the
            matches or sessions you are connected to.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the core functionality of counting and synchronizing scores</li>
            <li>To show live score updates across connected devices</li>
            <li>To send push notifications when scores are updated or important match events occur</li>
            <li>To maintain temporary or historical match data (where applicable)</li>
            <li>To improve stability, performance, and user experience of the App</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues or abuse</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
        <p>
            Match and score data may be stored on secure servers so that devices can stay synchronized and you can
            continue matches across sessions. We retain this data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes
            described in this policy or as required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases, you may be able to manually clear or reset matches and scores from within the App. Doing so
            will typically remove the related data from our active systems, although limited backups may remain for a
            short period as part of our normal backup and recovery process.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may share limited information in the following situations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party services (for example, cloud hosting
                providers or push notification services) to help us operate the App. These providers are only given
                access to information necessary to perform their tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
                or use it for any other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in
                response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or government agency).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Push Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses push notifications to inform users on connected devices about score changes and other
            match-related events.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can control notifications through your device’s system settings.</li>
            <li>If you disable notifications, you may not receive real-time score change alerts.</li>
            <li>Notification tokens are used only to deliver these messages and are not used for advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not specifically designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information,
            please contact us so we can take appropriate steps to delete such information.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access,
            loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to the information we store about you (if any)</li>
            <li>Request correction or deletion of your information</li>
            <li>Object to or limit certain types of processing</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on your consent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Some of these rights can be exercised directly within the App (for example, clearing match history).
            For any other requests, please contact us using the details provided below.
        </p>

        <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Our servers or service providers may be located in countries different from your own. By using the App,
            you understand that your information may be processed in these countries, which may have different data
            protection laws than your country of residence. We take steps to ensure that data is handled in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date
            at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. Your continued
            use of the App after any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the
            changes and your consent to abide by the updated policy.
        </p>
